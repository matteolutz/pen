**Pen** (<u>P</u>eople Search <u>En</u>gine) is a _proof of concept_ project that utilizes multiple technologies to create a search engine for people.
The project is currently using the following OSINT-sources:
- **(Reverse) Nominatim geocoding API** for geocoding addresses and reverse geocoding coordinates.
- **Google dorking** using a _Programmable Search Engine_ (CSE) to search for people on the web.
- **Local phone books** to search for phone numbers by name and address.


## The idea
**Pen** is a node-based search engine. Partial on a person is passed through so-called _transforms_, that add additional information to the person.
Each transform generates a list of _"individual"_ personal information, with each of them being passed to the next transform in the pipeline.

The tree that is generated by this process is then reduced to the least amount of real individuals (in the best case, only one) by merging the different information using an advanced _merging algorithm_.
